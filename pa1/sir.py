def count_infected(city):
    '''
    Count the number of infected people

    Inputs:
      city (list of strings): the state of all people in the
        simulation at the start of the day
    Returns (int): count of the number of people who are
      currently infected
    '''

def has_an_infected_neighbor(city, position):
    '''
    Determine whether a person has an infected neighbor

    Inputs:
      city (list): the state of all people in the simulation at the
        start of the day
      position (int): the position of the person to check

    Returns:
      True, if the person has an infected neighbor, False otherwise.
    '''

    # This function should only be called when the person at position
    # is susceptible to infection.

def advance_person_at_position(city, position, days_contagious):
    '''
    Compute the next state for the person at the specified position.

    Inputs:
      city (list): the state of all people in the simulation at the
        start of the day
      position (int): the position of the person to check
      days_contagious (int): the number of a days a person is infected

    Returns: (string) disease state of the person after one day
    '''

def simulate_one_day(starting_city, days_contagious):
    '''
    Move the simulation forward a single day.

    Inputs:
      starting_city (list): the state of all people in the simulation at the
        start of the day
      days_contagious (int): the number of a days a person is infected

    Returns:
      new_city (list): disease state of the city after one day
    '''

def run_simulation(starting_city, days_contagious,
                   random_seed=None, vaccine_effectiveness=0.0):
    '''
    Run the entire simulation

    Inputs:
      starting_city (list): the state of all people in the city at the
        start of the simulation
      days_contagious (int): the number of a days a person is infected
      random_seed (int): the random seed to use for the simulation
      vaccine_effectiveness (float): the chance that a vaccination will be
        effective

    Returns tuple (list of strings, int): the final state of the city
      and the number of days actually simulated.
    '''
 
def vaccinate_city(starting_city, vaccine_effectiveness):
    '''
    Vaccinate everyone in a city

    Inputs:
      starting_city (list): the state of all people in the simulation at the
        start of the simulation
      vaccine_effectiveness (float): the chance that a vaccination will be
        effective

    Returns:
      new_city (list): state of the city after vaccinating everyone in the city
    '''

def calc_avg_days_to_zero_infections(
        starting_city, days_contagious,
        random_seed, vaccine_effectiveness,
        num_trials):
    '''
    Conduct N trials with the specified vaccine effectiveness and
    calculate the average number of days for a city to reach zero
    infections

    Inputs:
      starting_city (list): the state of all people in the city at the
        start of the simulation
      days_contagious (int): the number of a days a person is infected
      random_seed (int): the starting random seed. Use this value for
        the FIRST simulation, and then increment it once for each
        subsequent run.
      vaccine_effectiveness (float): the chance that a vaccination will be
        effective
      num_trials (int): the number of trials to run

    Returns (float): the average number of days for a city to reach zero
      infections
